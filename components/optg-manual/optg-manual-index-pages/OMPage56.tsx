                      Unlike other modes of transport, train movements are controlled throughout their formation and run. Their priority for running and consequently their transit time and speed are affected by every station, section, division and zone they pass through.

                      Train operations thus require close coordination at all these levels. Working of trains is the most efficient when the best asset utilization is achieved and the needs of passenger & freight customers are satisfied to the maximum extent.
