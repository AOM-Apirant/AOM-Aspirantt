            <p>
              Passes and PTOs are not transferable and should be used only by the person
              in whose favour they have been issued. Special care should be taken to ensure
              that passes and PTO&apos;s are not lost while in the custody of the pass holder. In
              the case of loss the pass or privilege ticket order may pass into unauthorised
              hands leading to fraudulent use for which the pass or PTO holder may have to share responsibility and be also liable for action under the rules. In case of loss
              of pass or PTO a report should be made immediately to the police by the pass
              or PTO holder sending a copy of the same to the Pass/Privilege Ticket Order
              issuing authority.
